An important step in becoming more eco-friendly is to consume local and seasonal produce.  
This package is meant to make the process of eco-conscious consumption easier.  
  
The package will consist of different functions all designed to return information about seasonal food. The main function "whatsinseason()" will require 2 arguments: time and place, and it will return a list of produce that is in season for that time and place. 

### Ideas for further functions that can be built into this package:  
  
* Data about the climate impact of each fruit/vegetable.  
* Links to online recipies including the fruit/vegetable.
